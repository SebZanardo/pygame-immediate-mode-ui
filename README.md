# pygame immediate mode ui
Some quick and dirty code I wrote on the train up to Newcastle because I was fed up with other UI solutions  
  
__Features:__
* Global style defintion for elements
* Text
* Button
* Checkbox
* Slider (state managed by global context)
* Function call to place elements beside each other
* Function call to jump next position to any 2D coordinate
  
We ended up using an improved version of this code for a 2 day game jam
